        <h2 class="masubitext">What is Spam Masubi?</h2>
        <p class="masubitext">OK, I know what you are thinking right now. What the heck is Musubi? Maybe the next thing you are thinking is “EW…SPAM!” Am I right? The only people who might know what this is are those of you visiting this site from Hawaii or another Pacific island (I’m sure you know exactly what Spam Musubi is).</p>
        <p class="masubitext">For those of you who have never lived in or visited Hawaii, allow me to enlighten you for a moment. Spam became increasingly popular in Hawaii after WWII, it was sent to the troops stationed in Hawaii and kind of spread from there. It was cheap. It was easy to cook. And it still is! It is actually one of the staple foods there still today.</p>
        <ul class="masubitext">Ingredients:
            <li>12 ounces Spam</li>
            <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>   
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>Nori roasted seaweed used for sushi, cut into halves or thirds</li>
            <li>6 cups cooked sushi rice WITHOUT the vinegar mixture added</li>
        </ul>
        <ol class="masubitext">Steps:
            <li>Slice the SPAM into about 8-10 slices (depending on how thick you like it) and put in a Ziplock bag. Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag with the SPAM. Marinate for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired doneness. Some people like to glaze the SPAM with the marinade/sauce AFTER frying, either way tastes great!</li>
            <li>Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean surface (shiny side down). Place your Musubi mold across the middle of the nori. Add Sushi Rice to the mold, pressing down firmly and evenly, so there is about 1-1 1/2 inches of rice. (dip the mold and your fingers in water as you go to prevent sticking) </li>
            <li>Next, remove the mold from the rice. Now you will have a nice little block of rice right on the nori. Add some of the cooked spam to the top. Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it to the top of the SPAM, then wrap up the other side. Just like you are wrapping a nice little package. Use a little water on your finger to seal if needed. Serve warm.</li>
